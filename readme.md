## Vermillion Gym Pokemon Game:
- Student project. A little game app, to practice fetching from an api, promises, and animations. Also experimented with setTimeout with DOM manipulation.

- Code used:
    - ES6: promisifying vanilla XMLHttpRequest object via vanilla JS Promises; JS factory functions. 
    - DOM manipulation with setTimeout and vanilla JS, to render animations. 
    - CSS Animations combine our @keyframes CSS animations with the animate.css library.
    - Express server with EJS view engine.
    - Game rendering via client-side JS file. /public/javascripts/main.js
