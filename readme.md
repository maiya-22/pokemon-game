## Vermillion Gym Pokemon Game:
- A little game app, to practice fetching from an api, promises, and animations.

- Code used:
    - ES6: promisifying vanilla XMLHttpRequest object via vanilla JS Promises; JS factory functions. 
    - DOM manipulation with setTimeout and vanilla JS, to render animations. 
    - CSS Animations combine our @keyframes CSS animations with the animate.css library.
    - Express server with EJS view engine.
    - Game rendering via client-side JS file. /public/javascripts/main.js

#### Project Status:

- Re-initializing repository, in order to refactor from serverless html to express server.
- Deployed on Heroku: https://vermillion-pokemon-game.herokuapp.com/.
- Stat animation calling setTimeout about 200 times (inside loop). Maybe should refactor with pure CSS animation.
